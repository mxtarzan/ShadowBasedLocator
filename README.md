# ShadowBasedLocator
CSC499 Research Project

ShadowBasedLocator is a program that will accurately approximate the location
of the image based on the time and date it was taken. It will provide a gui 
that the user will label the image with points for a structure's top and bottem
that the hieght is know and the start and end of the shadow. Given this
infomation the length of the shadow will be claculated based on geometry and 
be used to pinpoint the location. Three images will be needed to generate a
accurate location. 

You will need: Java, GNUPlot and Eclipse
