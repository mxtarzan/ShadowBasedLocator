Space Ship Shooter

Difficulties I ran into:
  -Absolute boxes, these required simple cosine and 
sine usage that I needed to refresh myself on.
  -deleting objects in objectList, for a while I was crashing 
becasue I was deleting in a for loop incorrectly. Now i have 
a deletedobject list that i clear and fill each update with objects 
that at the end of update get removed from objectList_

Structure:
  -Ship inharits the functions of GraphicObject, the constructor was modified
to support lives, score, and health
  -missle inharits graphic object, and is recycled from box because box had most
of the criteria from missle.
  -astroids are just animatedboxes

Completed:
  -To the best of my knowledge everything works,
-a,w,d for movement of the ship
-e for absolut boxes
-r for relative boxes
-' ' for missles
-c for cylinder world
-v for sphere world
-b for box world
-f for referance frame

astroids have three sizes, large will kill the ship by one life,
small and medium will damage ship, large astroid become medium astroids, which 
become small astroids. at 50 and lest health the ship looses the ablity to use
thrusters and can only shoot and rotate.

sphere world was implemented

damage, lives, and score were also implemented
